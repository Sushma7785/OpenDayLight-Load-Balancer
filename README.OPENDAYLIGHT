HOW TO BUILD
============
In order to build it's required to have JDK 1.7+ and Maven 3+, to get
a build going it's needed to:
1) From the root directory run
   "mvn clean install"
2) On succesfull completion go in the directory:
"opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target"

to pick the zip file of the distribution or controller can be executed
right from there going into the distribution directory.

Please note that this way no integration tests but only UT will be
executed, if you are planning on committing code be aware that the
code will be tested also for Integrations tests hence make sure before
submitting a patch to build using the command:
   "mvn clean install -Pintegrationtests"
to get IT executed.
